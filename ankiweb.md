## Hide Toolbar in Reviewer

**Hides the main window's toolbar when reviewing.**

The aim of the addon is to free up some vertical screen space while reviewing
cards. For me this is useful as I have many cards that contain diagrams which can
be fairly large. In addition. modern wide screen displays seem to feel more
cramped vertically than horizontally.

The toolbar is made visible again when viewing decks and the overview.

The commands that are usually found on the toolbar are added to a new
main window "Toolbar" menu. Shortcut keys should continue to function.
